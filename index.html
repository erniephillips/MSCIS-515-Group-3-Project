            Using cloud-based services as part of business operations has become commonplace in the last decade. These
            services provide numerous advantages such as long-term cost reductions, create operational and
            resource-based efficiencies, while also providing scalable solutions for software, hardware, networking, and
            infrastructure alike. These services typically fall under one of three types: Software as a Service,
            Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service. Small business must choose more carefully when
            considering moving parts of their business to the cloud. Beyond researching their own needs and goals to
            determine if cloud services are a good fit for their business, they must also consider which of the three
            will work best for them, as well as what type of deployment model to use.

            Cloud services are generally defined as resources and capabilities of information technology that are
            offered off-premises by a third party, referred to as a Cloud Service Provider. Present day cloud-based
            services have expanded and can currently be categorized into one of three main types of services:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud-hosted software applications, typically subscription based </li>
              <li>Examples: MS Office 365, Slack, DocuSign Google Apps such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet,
                Google Docs</li>
              <li>Example Service Providers: Google Apps, Dropbox, Big Commerce </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud-based software development tools </li>
              <li>Examples: Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services (Elastic Beanstalk), Google App Engine</li>
              <li>Example Service Providers: Amazon, Microsoft</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Data centers & storage, servers, networking, virtualization </li>
              <li>Examples: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Cisco Metacloud, Google Compute Engine</li>
              <li>Example Service Providers: Rackspace, Google Compute Engine </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The primary draws of using these services are that cloud services can help businesses save money and be more
            efficient with resources from a time, money, and human capital perspective, improve operational performance,
            improve security, as well as providing flexible and scalable platforms for business operations by
            outsourcing fractional or full information technology operations (Wamuyu, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, by leaving parts of a business to be cloud based, a business is giving up control since such
            services would then be with a third party and off-premises. In that same vein, businesses are at the mercy
            of the service provider to uphold security, privacy, and reliability which ultimately result in service
            level agreements to impose penalties when service providers fail to do so (Widyastuti & Irwansyah, 2017).

            Small businesses make up 99.7% of the employers in the United States and they generate collectively as much
            data as large enterprises. Cloud service providers create a shared technology which small businesses can use
            without the large costs and resources involved to implement individually.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine if cloud services are a good fit for a small business, a phased approach is used for taking
            inventory of current practices and processes, current business needs and areas of opportunity, as well as
            identifying the mapping of applications and workloads (Attaran & Woods, 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
            The first phase is the discovery phase, the business should learn about the different cloud services
            available, such as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, and identify their desired goals for moving to cloud, and everyone
            from each department is involved in the conversation to cover every possible aspect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the decision to implement cloud technology is made, it is important to document how the current service
            is used, to highlight and eliminate inefficient processes, and to discuss security practices, so that the
            transfer can be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the business is ready to map their application and workloads to the cloud service which will
            meet their desired goals for the identified processes. In this last phase it is crucial to discuss
            advantages such as enhanced reliability, and greater collaboration, against possible obstacles such as lack
            of resources, or cost management.

            At the end of this suggested research for a business to conduct prior to engaging in cloud services is a key
            implementation item, that of which deployment model to use. The four types of cloud deployment models are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Public cloud:</b> With low upfront costs and primary costs apportioned with a pay as you go model, the
              public cloud option is most common chosen model for deployment and is owned, deployed, monitored, and
              managed solely by the service provider. Through a process called provisioning, customers can use various
              cloud services instantly and can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously with their own share of
              computing resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Private cloud:</b> Unlike the public cloud model, a private deployment model is typically owned,
              deployed, and managed by the business but still use the service provider’s resources remotely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hybrid cloud:</b> Hybrid cloud deployments, as the name implies, combines aspects from both private and
              public. These may be used when a business is looking to use the cloud and needs some, but not all,
              resources and services to be on-premises while others may be service provider hosted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Communtity cloud:</b> The fourth type of deployment model is unique in that the focus is less about
              whether it is public, private, or hybrid and is more about how it is utilized. Community models are
              intended to be used by multiple groups of users and/or businesses, not just a single entity (Gilani and
              Salam, 2015).
            </li>

            Cloud services are expanding every day and are readily available to any small business with a good Internet
            connection. All stakeholders in the business should be consulted and a plan should be developed accordingly
            with all pros and cons addressed. The business may need to hire an outside vendor who is more familiar with
            the process for a successful transition. Once the transition has been made, the business should continually
            evaluate the success of using the cloud and always strive for improvement.
